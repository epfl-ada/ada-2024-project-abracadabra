    "# Part 7 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As a conclusion, through this notebook we have seen that it is difficult to classify the beers into universal and controversial classes. Therefore we switched to GMM. We ended up with a ratio of 46/44/9 for universal, neutral and controversial respectively. Furthermore the sentiment analysis provides further information about the beers. If we cluster on it, the labels remain at 95% similar as if we do not cluster with the sentiment analysis. We could use the sentiment analysis, however due to the 60% +1/-1 accuracy we decided that it may influence the result in a way we do not want to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following this we can analyze the relation with the alcohol by volume, number of rating and the user level. We need to be careful of edge cases. The universal frequency is positively correlated with the alcohol by volume and the number of ratings. The later one is also positively correlated with the controversial frequency. The abv has a higher absolute correlation value with the frequencies, it may be more of an underlying factor than the number of ratings for the classification. Finally we noticed that novice rater, representing a huge part of the users are more prone to rate non universal beers than the other graders.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the nationality plays a certain role, for the origin of the beer but also the origin of the user. We have seen that particularly the United States, which produces the biggest amount of beers (of the dataset) and has the biggest amount of users, has a trend often different from the other countries to grade a particular beer. \n",
    "\n",
    "This work contains a lot of nuancing and doors that where not followed due to a lack of time. Therefore a lot of work could be done to pursue this study.\n",
