    "We see that clusters do not match at all. For this we believe the cause is coming from the sentiment score. During the evaluation process of the model we saw that we had 66% of perfect accuracy if the texts are classified as 0,-1 or 1. Therefore it introduces a higher variance since we are not sure about the final score. We also see that number of beers per label differs from the initial clustering. In the end we would need real labels to have a sentiment score which would serve as ground truth and on which we could rely. For all this reason we decide to pursue the analysis of the next parts with the clusters discovered in part 2.\n",

    "In conclusion, sentiment analysis provides another attribute which is different from the other attributes filled in by the grader. However we need more accurate results or at least results on which we could rely more to be confident in using them for the next step of this analysis."
