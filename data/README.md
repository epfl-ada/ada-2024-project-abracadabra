For storage purposes, we decided to first save the TXT files into a CSV format. It has been done by using `TxtToCsv.ipynb`.
Furthermore, we wanted to grasp the data especially how the matched dataset was built. To fully understand the data and its caveat we used the file `data_understanding.ipynb`.
The data under the CSV format can be found at the following link (ask for permission):

To understand the Nan values and the grade span we used the `data_cleaning.ipynb` file. 
Further information can be found add `data/merge_into_onedataset.ipynb`. The transformed data can be found at the following link:

For more information look at the `results.ipynb` in the main branch, or look at the Markdowns in the different files mentionned above.
