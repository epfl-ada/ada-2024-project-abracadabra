For storage purposes, we decided to first save the TXT files into a CSV format. It has been done by using `TxtToCsv.ipynb`.
Furthermore, we wanted to grasp the data especially how the matched dataset was built. To fully understand the data and its caveat we used the file `data_understanding.ipynb`.
The data under the CSV format can be found at the following link (ask for permission):
